# SQL for ML — Cheat Sheet

This repository contains my SQL practice for AI and machine learning roles.

## Joins
### INNER JOIN
Used when we only want matching rows from both tables.

### LEFT JOIN
Used when we want to keep all rows from the left table even if there is no match.

## Window Functions
Window functions allow calculations across related rows without collapsing results.

### ROW_NUMBER
Used to rank rows within a group.

### LAG
Used to compare a row with the previous row.

## Why this matters
SQL is essential for:
- data extraction
- feature engineering
- model evaluation
